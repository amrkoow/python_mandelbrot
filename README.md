# python_mandelbrot
Claculates and displays mandelbrot sets using python. 

It's my first python project. Goal is to calculate mandelbrot sets with various boundary conditions:
- left,  right, upper and lower boundary
- maximum iterations
- limit of the absolute value of the complex number aboe which the iteration process is stopped
- output window size
- aspect ratio

Goal is to 
- have all the mentioned boundary conditions available via GUI
- render the output image faster
- (save images in .jpg, .tif, .bmp, (ascii))
- ((implement "paths" so successive images can be rendered resulting in a movie))

more information on fractals, which mandelbrot sets are a sub set of: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal

As I am a total newby in terms of programming, most of my code is copied from or "inspired" by people who have much more programming skills and furthermore kindly share their wisdom in this internets.
